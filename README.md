Note: It should be connected to the django backend, but that is a work in progress.
For now, it is basically the layout of the principal form, and also a simple login.

The router is already configured, with protected routes.

Also i like to use the shadcn components for the UI, but it could be bootstrap or whatever,
i use it because it is simple and easy to use, and also they are extensible and customizable with tailwindcss.

### TODO
- [ ] Connect with the backend.
- [ ] Add more forms.
- [ ] Add the reports section.
- [ ] Add the summary initial dashboard section.
- [ ] Add the products section.
- [ ] Add the clients section.
